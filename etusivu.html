        <h1>About me</h1> 
        <p>My name is Miko. I'm a 19-year-old programming student from Varkaus, Finland, but I currently reside in Lahti.</p>
        
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have quite a lot of things I'm interested in and follow on a regular basis, but the ones I'm most invested in are definitely MMA, video games, and basketball.</p>

        <h3>Life goals</h3>
        <p>My goals are really all over the place and change all the time, but one that has stuck around has to be actually competing in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). I would also like to move overseas for work after I'm done with school as my English and ability to learn languages in general has always been quite good. The extent of my motivation is usually just "sounds fun, why not," so I end up trying a lot of different stuff.</p>
