    <h1> About me;</h1> <p>My name is Miko I'm a 19 year old programming student from Varkaus, Finland.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
        I have quite a lot of things im interested in and follow on a regular basis but the ones im most invested in are definitely MMA, Video games and basketball.
</p>
<h3> Life goals </h3><p>My goals are really all around the place and change all the time but one that has stuck around has to be actually competing in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). I would also like to move overseas for work after im done with school as my english and ability to learn languages in general has always been quite good.
    The extent of my motivation is usually just "sounds fun, why not" so i end up trying a lot of different stuff.
