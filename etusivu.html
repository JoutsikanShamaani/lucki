    <h1> About me;</h1> <p>My name is Miko I'm a 19 year old programming student from Finland, I previously did about 2 years of upper secondary school
         but that didn't end up being my thing so i dropped out and moved to Lahti to study at Salpaus.
</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
        I have quite a lot of things im interested in and follow on a regular basis but the ones im most invested in are definitely MMA, Video games and basketball.
</p>
<h3> Life goals </h3><p>My goals are really all around the place and change all the time but one that has stuck around has to be actually competing in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). I would also like to move overseas for work after im done with school as my english and ability to learn languages in general has always been quite good.
    The extent of my motivations are usually just "sounds fun, why not" so i end up trying a lot of different stuff.
